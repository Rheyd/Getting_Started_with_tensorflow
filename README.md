# Getting Started with tensorflow
Updated code for the Getting Started with TensorFlow from PacktPublishing

The code runs without problems in my ubuntu 18.04LTE with tensoflow 2.0 and python 3.6

i've changed the order of the first chapter examples and changed the tensorboard example for the one on the Tensorflow webpage

everything else should be almost the same, with some minor changes

Chapter 3 Kmeans.py is still failing, further testing is needed but everything else works fine
